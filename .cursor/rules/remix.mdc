 You are an expert in Remix, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, Shopify, Shopify Polaris Design, Shopify Remix Js App, Shopify Graphql, Drizzle ORM with SQLite, zod focusing on scalable web development.
 
## Key Principles
- Provide clear, precise Remix and TypeScript examples.
- Apply immutability and pure functions where applicable.
- Favor route modules and nested layouts for composition and modularity.
- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `isAuthenticated`, `userRole`).
- Always use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`).
- Prefer named exports for loaders, actions, and components.

## TypeScript & Remix
- Define data structures with interfaces for type safety.
- Avoid the `any` type; fully utilize TypeScript's type system.
- Organize files: imports, loaders/actions, component logic.
- Use template strings for multi-line literals.
- Utilize optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- Use nested layouts and dynamic routes where applicable.
- Leverage loaders for efficient server-side rendering and data fetching.
- Use `useFetcher` and `useLoaderData` for seamless data management between client and server.

## File Naming Conventions
- `*.tsx` for React components.
- `*.ts` for utilities, types, non tsx realted code and configurations.
- `root.tsx` for the root layout.
- All files use kebab-case.

## Code Style
- Use single quotes for string literals.
- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Ensure clean code with no trailing whitespace.
- Use `const` for immutable variables.
- Use template strings for string interpolation.

## Remix-Specific Guidelines
- Use `<Link>` for navigation, avoiding full page reloads.
- Implement loaders and actions for server-side data loading and mutations.
- Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.
- Leverage route-based loading, error boundaries, and catch boundaries.
- Use the `useFetcher` hook for non-blocking data updates.
- Cache and optimize resource loading where applicable to improve performance.

## Import Order
1. Remix core modules
2. React and other core libraries
3. Third-party packages
4. Application-specific imports
5. Environment-specific imports
6. Relative path imports

## Error Handling and Validation
- Implement error boundaries for catching unexpected errors.
- Use custom error handling within loaders and actions.
- Validate user input on both client and server using formData or JSON.

## Testing
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component testing.
- Write tests for loaders and actions ensuring data correctness.
- Mock fetch requests and responses where applicable.

## Performance Optimization
- Prefetch routes using `<Link prefetch="intent">` for faster navigation.
- Defer non-essential JavaScript using `<Scripts defer />`.
- Optimize nested layouts to minimize re-rendering.
- Use Remix's built-in caching and data revalidation to optimize performance.

## Security
- Prevent XSS by sanitizing user-generated content.
- Use Remix's CSRF protection for form submissions.
- Handle sensitive data on the server; never expose it in client code.

## Shopify Remix Guidelines
- **Shopify API Integration:**
  - Use Shopify's GraphQL API within loaders and actions for efficient data fetching.
  - Securely store and manage Shopify API keys and tokens using environment variables.
  - Leverage the Shopify Storefront API for dynamic commerce experiences.
- **UI/UX and Polaris Design:**
  - Integrate Shopify Polaris Design components for a consistent and accessible UI.
  - Customize Polaris components using TailwindCSS when necessary.
  - Adhere to Shopify Polaris guidelines for accessibility and responsive design.
- **Project Structure & Organization:**
  - Use nested layouts for Shopify sections to promote reusability and maintainability.
- **Data Management and GraphQL:**
  - Define Shopify data structures with TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
  - Validate and sanitize data coming from Shopify APIs with `zod`.
  - Use `useLoaderData` to fetch Shopify data and ensure seamless client-server integration.
- **Performance and Caching:**
  - Optimize Shopify API calls with caching strategies and efficient server-side rendering.
  - Defer non-critical Shopify component loading using Remix's data fetching strategies.
- **Error Handling and Testing:**
  - Implement error boundaries specifically for Shopify API interactions.
  - Write comprehensive tests for Shopify loaders, actions, and components using `@testing-library/react`.
  - Mock Shopify API responses for reliable and isolated testing.

## Final Notes
- Maintain consistency in code style and conventions across the project.
- Regularly update dependencies and follow the latest Remix and Shopify best practices.
- Refer to @Remix Documentation and [Shopify Polaris Documentation](mdc:https:/polaris.shopify.com) for the latest guidelines.
